- Once the necessary data files are downloaed, the 'Process' button will be enabled. Click the 'Process' button to process the raw data for use with HERBS. Processing will take at least half an hour and the popup window will disappear after the process is done. If the user wishes to change between atlases (e.g. switching from Waxholm to Allen), the 'Process' step must be repeated for the new atlas. HERBS uses whichever atlas was processed most recently.
